      <h1>The Call of Cthulhu</h1>

      <h2>Author: H. P. Lovecraft</h2>

    <p>The Horror in Clay</p>
    <p>The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the
      human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of
      ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we
      should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto
      harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open
      up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from
      the
      revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.
    </p>
    <p>Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form
      transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked
      by
      a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me
      when I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed
      out
      from an accidental piecing together of separated things—in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a
      dead
      professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out; certainly, if I live, I shall never
      knowingly
      supply a link in so hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep silent regarding the part
      he knew, and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.
